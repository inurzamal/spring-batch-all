Spring Batch is all about Steps & Job. <br>
Create Steps, provide the steps to Job, execute the Job.  <br>
We can create two types of steps: i) Tasklet steps ii) Chunk oriented steps. <br>
A Job can have single or multiple steps. <br>
One step may have single or multiple task (like reading data from a source, process it, wrting to another data source and sending an email could be part of another step) <br>
